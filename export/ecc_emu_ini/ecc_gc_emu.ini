[emu:gcemu]
name=GCEmu
Notes=GCEmu is a very incomplete emulator for the Nintendo Gamecube. It uses recompilation techniques and other tricks to achieve a reasonable speed. Although emulation is very incomplete, it shows that 'it can be done' and can be done at a decent speed.

[emu:gcube]
name=Gcube
Notes=Gcube is a very impressive GameCube emulator, available for Windows as well as Mac and Linux. Unfortunately Gcube does not have a graphical interface, and as such, is command-line driven, so reading the documentation would be advisable. Gcube is able to play into many games, but was unfortunately discontinued. However, Monk has released the source code to the emulator so any other developer is free to pick up the project and continue development.
