Notes                   = The FreeDO (closed-source) project exists to bring about an emulator or simulator capable of playing content originally made for the now-defunct and no longer commercially available 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, a 32-bit video game console that was licensed to manufacturers and developers, and marketed worldwide in the early to middle 1990s.
