Notes		= XEBRA is a Sony Playstation 1 and PocketStation emulator. NOTE: To run PocketStation games you need both XEBRA and PK201. Basically, you put both emulators in a folder together with respective FROM, KROM and OSROM files, run PK201 and do the initial setup, select File -> Save STAT and close it. Now you run XEBRA, select whatever game you like, then select Run -> Run-1/2/3 to start the game. When in game, select Run -> Outer Card to start the PocketStation emulation.
