Notes		= No$msx is a MSX1 + MSX2 emulator for DOS and Windows, like the other no$-emulators it's including a comfortable debugger, so that it's more a serious development tool than just a emulator. Beside for the development part, the most important goals are: User-friendly GUI and lots of options, and the complete lack of overload - the program is written in raw assembler language, sized about 150 KBytes, and works fine on 33MHz computers.
