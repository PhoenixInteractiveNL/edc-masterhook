Notes                   = atari++ is an emulator for (now rather aged) Atari 8 bit computers. It emulates the Atari800, Atari400, the 800XL and 600XL, the 65XE and 130XE and the Atari 5200 Game Console. The emulation is cycle-precise, that is 'on the fly' modifications of chip registers will be visible on the screen immediately, emulating even programs using horizontal kernel tricks correctly.
