Notes                   = A gameboy emulator written in Pure Lua. Approaching feature completeness, but still a work in progress. This is designed to be fairly cross platform, and currently consists of a platform-independent gameboy module which contains the emulator, and a Love2D interface, presently the only supported platform.
