Notes		= DeSmuME is a freeware emulator for the NDS roms & Nintendo DS Lite and DSi games created by YopYop156. DeSmuME is also known as YopYop DS is written in C++ for Microsoft Windows and can play Nintendo DS homebrew and commercial nds roms. The emulator its self is in French (with full user translations to English and other languages). But even French version of DeSmuME is easy to navigate through menus as it has a similar users interface to DSemu. It supports many homebrew nds rom demoes as well as a handful of Wireless Multiboot demo nds roms. DeSmuME is also able to emulate nearly all of the commercial nds rom titles which other DS Emulators like iDeaS and Dualis aren't capable of running.
