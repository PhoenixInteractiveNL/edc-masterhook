Notes                   = plus4emu is an open source, portable emulator of the Commodore 264 family of computers (C16, C116, and Plus/4), written in C++, and supporting Windows and POSIX platforms (32 bit Windows, 32 and 64 bit Linux, and MacOS X have been tested). It implements accurate, high quality hardware emulation, however, the system requirements are higher than that of most other emulators
