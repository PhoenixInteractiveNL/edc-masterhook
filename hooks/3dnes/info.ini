Notes		= 3DNes is an emulator that renders Nintendo Entertainment System games in 3D with a VR option on the way. If you really want to see something a bit special, it's definitely worth trying this emulator. To display a game in 3D, the emulator requires the game ROM and a special '.3dn' file for which the Author has set up a repository here: https://itch.io/board/28136/3dn-showcase-and-sharing
