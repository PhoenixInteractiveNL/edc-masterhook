Notes		= Caprice32 is a software emulator of the Amstrad CPC 8bit home computer series. The emulator faithfully imitates the CPC464, CPC664, and CPC6128 models. By recreating the operations of all hardware components at a low level, the emulator achieves a high degree of compatibility with original CPC software.
