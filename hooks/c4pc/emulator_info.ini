[EMULATOR]
Author		= Tim Schuerewegen aka FireFly
Contact		= c4pc#skynet*be
License		= UNKNOWN
BiosNeeded	= 1
Website		= http://users.skynet.be/firefly/cybiko/
Notes		= This emulator is not intended to be used to PLAY / RUN / USE, but to TEST Cybiko software with. Only experienced Cybiko software developers should use this software. The emulation is very unstable and does NOT represent the Cybiko device/games/apps in any way. Hence, many games/apps don't work, which isn't the case on a REAL Cybiko.
