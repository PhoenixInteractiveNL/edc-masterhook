Notes                   = WinBoycott has a high compatibility rate and reasonable speed. This emulator is however lacking a full-screen mode and any type of hardware acceleration. Classic GameBoy, Super GameBoy and GameBoy Color are all supported by this emulator. This is a port of the DOS-based GameBoy emulator Boycott.
