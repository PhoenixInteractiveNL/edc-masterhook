Notes                   = TGB Dual is a Game Boy / Game Boy Color emulator that supports loading two different roms at the same time. When you have have two roms loaded they are linked with an emulated link cable. This means you can trade Pokemon between two different games, for example between Red and Blue. Two people can play two different GameBoy games on one PC at the same time, using a keyboard. IT's also possible to link TGB Dual running on two different PC's on the same network, or over the internet if using a VPN.
