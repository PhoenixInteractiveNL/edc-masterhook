## EDC MasterHook

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/PhoenixInteractiveNL/emuControlCenter/images/img_misc_cabinet.png)

emuDownloadCenter (EDC) is a program to download ROM emulators from internet.
Mostly in depots where found emulators on the internet are stored.
Author: Sebastiaan Ebeltjes, Deventer (Netherlands)

EDC is part of emuControlCenter, homepage/download:

### Emulatorlist.ini

To prevent folder names with spaces and give nice emulator names in EDC listings, this ini wil link those names.

**INI SECTION = ECCID**

Format: `FOLDER=EMULATORNAME`
***
### Emulator Hooks

Every emulator (not versions) is put in in the `downloadhooks\[emulatorfoldername]` folder, in here 3 files are stored:

2 INI files wich contain data

1 JPG file wich is a screenshot of the emulator (in action)

    [emulatorfoldername]_downloads.ini
    [emulatorfoldername]_info.ini
    [emulatorfoldername]_screen

### Emulator INFO INI

Example Contents (Emulator Potator for Watara Supervision):

    [INFO]
    InfoVersion         = 1.0.0.0

    [EMULATOR]
    Author              = David Raingeard
    Contact             = david*raingeard#laposte*net
    License             = Freeware
    BiosNeeded          = 0
    Website             = 
    Notes               = This appears to be the first Watara Supervision emulator for Windows. It uses the SDL library and has good compatibility.

Please note the Email is masked to prevent spamming (*=. | #=@)

    [INFO]
    InfoVersion	        = Version of the INI file layout.

    [EMULATOR]
    Author              = Author of the emulator.
    Contact             = Possible E-mail of the Author.

### Emulator DOWNLOADS INI

**INI SECTION = VERSION**

**EMU** contents are EMULATOR relative.

**CFG** contents are ECC relative.

**INFO** contents are FILE relative, and are generated by the EDC manager (you may fill these yourself)
