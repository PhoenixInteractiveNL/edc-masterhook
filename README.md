### Emulatorlist.ini

To prevent folder names with spaces and give nice emulator names in EDC listings, this ini wil link those names 

Format: `FOLDER=EMULATORNAME`

### Emulator Hooks

Every emulator (not versions) is put in in the `downloadhooks\[emulatorfoldername]` folder, in here 3 files are stored:

2 INI files wich contain data

1 JPG file wich is a screenshot of the emulator (in action)

    [emulatorfoldername]_downloads.ini
    [emulatorfoldername]_info.ini
    [emulatorfoldername]_screen
