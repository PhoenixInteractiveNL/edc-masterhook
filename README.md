emuDownloadCenter (EDC) is a module of emuControlCenter to download ROM emulators from internet.
Mostly in depots where found emulators on the internet are stored.
Author: Sebastiaan Ebeltjes, Deventer (Netherlands)

EDC is part of [**emuControlCenter**](https://github.com/PhoenixInteractiveNL/emuControlCenter/wiki)

**Descriptions howto fill data are below**

Q: _Why are the more repo's?_

A: Because a GitHub repository is limited to 1 GB size.

***
Some site's to get emulators:

[emulator-zone](http://www.emulator-zone.com) | 
[emulatorworld](http://www.emulatorworld.com/) |

## Emulatorlist.ini

To prevent folder names with spaces and give nice emulator names in EDC listings, this ini wil link those names.

**INI SECTION = ECCID**

Format: `FOLDER=EMULATORNAME`
***
## Emulator Hooks

Every emulator (not versions) are put in a `downloadhooks\[emulatorfoldername]` folder, in here 3 files are stored:

2 INI files wich contain data

1 JPG file wich is a screenshot of the emulator (in action)

    [emulatorfoldername]_downloads.ini
    [emulatorfoldername]_info.ini
    [emulatorfoldername]_screen

**Please note: all in lowercase names!**

## Emulator INFO INI

Example Contents (Emulator Potator for Watara Supervision):

## Emulator DOWNLOADS INI

**INI SECTION = VERSION**

**EMU** contents are EMULATOR relative.

**CFG** contents are ECC relative.

**INFO** contents are FILE relative, and are generated by the EDC manager (you may fill these yourself)

_**Please note: Newest emulator version at the top of the file, the oldest version at the bottom! (version descending)**_

## The download folder

Every emulator version needs 3 files:

    [version].7z
    [version]_changelog.txt
    [version]_contents.txt

### Changelog
The changelog for this version, you may need to search for it on the emulator website, or any readme document in the archive...

Note that if there are more builds of the same version, then just copy the changelog, example:

1.0-win32_changelog.txt
1.0-win64_changelog.txt (same contents as above)

### Contents
Archive contents (will be created by EDC manager)

***
Please leave these emulators out for now:

- Emulators for **Linux** and **MacOs** (you can add them to the repo, don't add them in downloads.ini)
- Emulators **Source** files (you can add them to the repom, don't add them in downloads.ini)
- Emulators that have **installers** to run first.
- Emulators that are **Java** based (JAR).
