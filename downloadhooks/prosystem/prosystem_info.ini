Notes		= ProSystem is an emulator for the Windows operating system that will allow you to play Atari 7800 video games on your PC. An emulator is a program that has the ability to imitate another program, device, or computer. The ProSystem emulator imitates the Atari 7800's CPU, video, audio, joystick controls, etc. Before you can use the emulator, you will need to obtain rom images that are compatible with the Atari 7800.
